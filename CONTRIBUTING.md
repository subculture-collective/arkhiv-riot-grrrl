# Contributing

This repository holds the Riot Grrrl Zine Archive, a separate copy of the SUBCULT Arkhiv archive software. Keep changes small and reviewable.

## Development flow

1. Create or pick an issue before making non-trivial changes.
2. Create a branch from `main`.
3. Make the smallest change that satisfies the issue.
4. Run verification:

   ```bash
   make verify
   ```

5. Open a pull request using the PR template.
6. Link the issue with `Closes #N` when appropriate.

## Commit style

Prefer concise conventional-style subjects:

```text
feat: add subject filter to the catalog
docs: update source update runbook
fix: keep page links after a reader reload
chore: refresh web lockfile
```

## Open Pilot issues

Use `.gitea/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/open-pilot-task.yaml` for tasks that Open Pilot should implement.

Open Pilot requires:

- `ready-for-agent`
- `agent:queued`
- a deterministic `Test Command`

The template adds `ready-for-agent`; add `agent:queued` only after the issue is complete and ready for automation.

Good Open Pilot tasks are:

- one focused outcome
- clear context and constraints
- explicit out-of-scope notes
- verifiable from the repository root

## Verification commands

Use the narrowest deterministic command that proves the change.

Default full check:

```bash
make verify
```

Narrower examples:

```bash
cd backend && go test ./...
pnpm --dir web run test
make test-operations
docker compose config --quiet
```
